<div class="ui segment"><h3 class="ui header">As an intermediate service <div class="sub header">With a business operations</div></h3><p> Since our B2C product is focused on a localized level, our business to business services act as inter-business tool for administrating accounts, remote premises and comparing a wide range of related consumer usage reports. Due the fact the range of structural size of businesses that could use our services this will need to be a dynamic pricing model so that low fixed prices are not abused by multinational organizations, while excessively high fixed prices would out-price smaller multi-region business. So the price model may have to work on a factor of how many accounts and locations they administrate/contribute to.</p> <p>Another b2b exchanges that could be integrated in to the product would be allow front-end (the user interface) developers to sell customized "dashboards" (charts, graphs and data) using d3.js and related libraries </p>


<h3 class="ui header">As a business <div class="sub header"></div>trading directly with another business</h3> <p>Since this is going to be where the revenue is generated, by other business paying to use our services we have a responsibility ensure that they receive the utility implicitly (if not directly) promised with relative ease. This means that a lot of work as to be done properly integrating MVC conventions with user friendly UI ( MVC stands for model, view, controller, it's how data is modeled, views are rendered and controllers operate between the two. UI is for user interface) so that data can be exchanged and understood.</p>

<h3 class="ui header"> As a micro business facilitator</h3>
<p> Enabling developers to create and sell unique logos, digital leaflets, data dash boards and UI using open source libraries such as d3.js, dc.js, nvd3 is an option as it both allows more datasets to be added to the service along with delegating some of the user interface work to more experience/skilled persons who create and sell (or give-away) front-end data visualizations.</p><p> Side note: the previously mentioned libraries have been used (in a very basic way) in this document to create the graphs and charts in the market data section</p>
